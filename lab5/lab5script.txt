#welcome to your first r script (in EEB225 at least)
#now you have this open, paste it into the script window in RStudio

#comments look like this!
#any line that begins with a hash is not run

#every script should normally start with a brief comment saying what it is meant to do
#this script is to run an ANOVA on the height data from our barley lab. 
#and hopefully get you points for your grade!

#the next thing we have to do is say where our data is and read it in
#you will need to modify this based on where yours is (1 point):

setwd("C:/Users/jeremy/Documents/lab5/")
soildata<-read.csv("heightdata2015.csv")

#verify we loaded it ok
head(soildata)

#checking for violation of assumptions
#plot - what is our dependent variable? enter it after the ~ below to plot your graph
plot(soildata$Height~)

#Let's check for normality
shapiro.test(subset(soildata,water=="+")$Height)
shapiro.test(subset(soildata,water=="-")$Height)
shapiro.test(subset(soildata,fertiliser=="+")$Height)
shapiro.test(subset(soildata,fertiliser=="-")$Height)
#end of shapiro tests

#bartlett tests
bartlett.test(soildata$Height~soildata$water)
bartlett.test(soildata$Height~soildata$fertiliser)
#end of bartlett tests

#How would I get help for these two functions?
#type in the lines below (1 point)

#running a one way anova
#to run an anova in r, we use the aov command. We use the summary function to get out the data we need
summary(aov(soildata$Height~soildata$water))
#enter your anova for fertiliser below (1 point)


#

#enter your two way anova code below (1 point)

#enter your code for your own analysis here (2 points)
